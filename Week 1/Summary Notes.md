**Dominant Strategies**
A dominant strategy for a player is one that produces the highest payoff of any strategy available for every possible action by the other players.
i.e. the utility of choosing action ai for agent i will be greater than or equal to choosing to any other strategy a'i

Weakly dominant: greater than or equal

Strictly dominant: greater than only

  

eg. for the prisoners' dilemma, defecting is always the strictly dominant strategy for both because regardless of what the other player chooses, this player choosing to defect always yields a higher payoff (Player 1 chooses cooperate, Player 2: 0 (defect) > -1 (cooperate); Player 1 chooses defect, Player 2: -2 (defect) > -3 (cooperate))
