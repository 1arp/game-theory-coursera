Lecture Slides, Notes and Problem Set Assignment Solutions to the [Coursera Game Theory course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1) by Stanford University and The University of British Columbia

**Instructors**: [Matthew O. Jackson](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/jacksonm), [Kevin Leyton-Brown](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/kevinlb), [Yoav Shoham](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~1251)

## Introduction
This repository contains all the lecture slides, summary notes I made myself to understand the content, as well as problem set solutions & explanations to all 8 weeks of the course. Full credit goes to the instructors for the lecture slides, I am merely posting them here for easy access. 
The quiz explanations are uploaded only for reference purposes. Please attempt the quiz yourself and only look at the explanations if you find that you still can't understand it after consulting the discussion forums and reviewing the lecture content.
